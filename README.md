EthioTime app

Ethiopia is three hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. The 12-hour clock is sometimes used locally and this can be confusing to visitors. The day starts with the sunrise i.e. the first cycle starts with "one O'clock" at 7 A.M. and goes on to "12 O'clock" at 6 P.M. The second cycle starts at 7 P.M. "one O'clock" and goes on to 6 A.M. "12 O'clock". 

This application shows 3 times types: 

- Local Time (user local time) 
- Ethiopian Local Time ( 24-hour clock) 
- Ethiopian Local Time ( 12-hour clock) 

Enjoy Ethiopia
